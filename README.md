# RustNethuns: a rewrite in Rust of the Nethuns unified API for fast and portable network programming

RustNethuns is a rewrite in Rust of [Nethuns](https://github.com/larthia/nethuns), a fast C-based network I/O library.
The aim of this work has been to evaluate the *high performance* and *strong safety* claims made by the Rust programming language, specifically in the domain of low-level network programming.

This project serves as the central element of Riccardo Sagramoni's MSc thesis in Computer Engineering.

## What is Nethuns?

Nethuns is a software library (originally written in C) that provides a unified API to access and manage low-level network operations over different underlying network I/O frameworks, and consequently operating systems.
The design of Nethuns originates from the practical requirement of developing portable network applications with extremely high data rate target.
Instead of re-writing the applications to match the underlying network I/O engines available over the different operating systems, Nethuns offers a unified abstraction layer that allows programmers to implement their applications regardless of the underlying technology.
Therefore, network applications that use the Nethuns library only need to be re-compiled to run on top of a different engine (chosen in the set of the ones available for the OS), with no need for code adaptation.

Nethuns would like to fill the lack of a unified network abstraction in the software domain, which is instead present in the hardware domain thanks to [P4](https://p4.org/).
Nethuns should play a similar role to that entrusted to the [pcap](https://www.tcpdump.org/) library in the past.
In addition, it adds support for recent technologies such as [AF_XDP](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/af_xdp.rst) and concurrency.
Of course, all of this is provided to network programmers while minimizing the overhead, in order not to impact the performance of native underlying network I/O frameworks.
The API exposed by Nethuns recalls the interface of UNIX sockets to make immediate and simple its adoption to experienced network programmers.

Currently, the Rust-based Nethuns library fully supports only the [netmap](https://github.com/luigirizzo/netmap) framework for fast packet I/O over Linux.


## Why a Rust-based Nethuns library?

The Rust programming language is able to maintains *analogous performance* of the C programming language, while ensuring a **significant higher level of memory and thread safety**, mostly at compilation time.
These features makes Rust a suitable candidate for replacing C and C++ (which are unsafe and error-prone to use) in the domain of network programming.


## RustNethuns basic API

- Open a new socket using the options in `opt`

```rust
let socket: BindableNethunsSocket = BindableNethunsSocket::open(options).unwrap();
```

- Bind the socket to a specific queue/any queue of `dev`

```rust
let socket: NethunsSocket = socket.bind(dev, queue).unwrap();
```

- Get the next unprocessed received packet

```rust
let packet: RecvPacket = socket.recv().unwrap()
```

- Release a buffer previously obtained from `NethunsSocket::recv()`

```rust
drop(packet); // <-- optional (it will automatically called when `packet` goes out of scope)
```

- Queue up a packet for transmission

```rust
socket.send(packet).unwrap();
```

- Send all queued up packets

```rust
socket.flush().unwrap();
```

- Unbind the device and destroy the socket

```rust
drop(socket); // <-- optional (it will automatically called when `socket` goes out of scope)
```


## Dependencies

The RustNethuns library relies on the following dependencies:

- **rustc** compiler.
- [**libclang**](https://clang.llvm.org/doxygen/group__CINDEX.html) library with *Clang 5.0 or greater*, needed to automatically generate the bindings to the underlying C-based I/O frameworks.
- [**netmap**](https://github.com/luigirizzo/netmap) library, needed to enable netmap support.


## Cargo features

- `netmap`: enables the netmap framework for network I/O.
- `NETHUNS_USE_BUILTIN_PCAP_READER`: use a built-in reader for PCAP files in place of the standard one for `NethunsSocketPcap`. The built-in reader gives both reading and writing capabilities to the programmer, whereas the standard one allows only reading.


## Using the library to implement a brand new application

The current version of the library is not ready to be published on [crates.io](crates.io), so you need to specify RustNethuns as a [*git* dependency](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html#specifying-dependencies-from-git-repositories).
